A simple shopping UI features a home screen with a product grid, a search bar, and category filters. Each product shows an image, name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. The cart page lists selected items with quantity controls and a checkout button. The checkout page includes address, payment options, and a final "Place Order" button.
